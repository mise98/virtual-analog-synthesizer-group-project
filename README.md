# virtual-analog-synthesizer-group-project
A group project where we did a sound synthesizer that works with connected MIDI keyboard. Theme of the  synthesizer sound design is the 80's.

# Info
We made audio synthesizer with wide customizability. The synthesizer interface includes a virtual keyboard with which the synthesizer can be played. From the virtual keyboard you can modify oscillator type, amplitude profile and effect. The synthesizer interface includes also control window where can modify cutoff frequency of the filter, frequency of the low-frequency oscillator, gain of the amplitude, duration of the signal and phase lengths in the ADSR. The control window also has a graph of the audio signal produced by the synthesizer.

The type of synthesis is virtual analog synthesis, which has generally emulated analog synthesis widely used in 70s and 80s music. It is also possible to play the synthesizer with MIDI keyboard. 

References and more information about the project can be found in the file report.pdf.

# My part in the project
My part in the project was to be involved in the design and implementation of the synthesis and effects and implement a control window where sliders, switches and the graph of the audio signal is.
